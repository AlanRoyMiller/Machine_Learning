Image Depixelation (README)

This project aims to recreate the pixelated areas within an image using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The performance of the model will be evaluated using the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of the predicted pixels.

This is a project intended for learning purposes. By working on this project, I am gaining experience in image processing, deep learning, and data analysis.
