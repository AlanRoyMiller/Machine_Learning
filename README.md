Welcome to our image depixelation project!

Our goal is to develop an image depixelation algorithm that can improve the quality of low-resolution images by removing the pixelated artifacts and enhancing the details. We are currently in the process of developing and testing various models and techniques to achieve this goal.

At the moment, the image depixelation tool is still in development and is not yet fully functional. We are working hard to optimize the algorithms and improve the performance of the tool. Once the development is complete, we will release the final version of the tool to the public.

We appreciate your interest in our project and hope that you will stay tuned for future updates.
